1. Incident commander name:
   Jason Wee

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   An attacker successfully access to the cluster and launch 3 pods running each crypto mining each. Each of these pods took up CPU significantly and impact our service.

3. Summary of what was affected:
   cpu is heavily utilized and cluster under heavy load and slow responsive. This cause valid service requests slow in responding to client requests.
   
4. Summmry of the impact:
   Attacker managed to gain access to the cluster and run the crypto mining software.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
   force delete of the pods from the cluster, and the cpu usage back to normal and service back to responsive.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
   the cluster should be harden and especially restrict access to the cluster. Alert need to be setup should cpu usage goes 100% for a period of time in the future.
