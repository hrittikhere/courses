1. Incident commander name:
   Jason Wee

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
   An attacker successfully access to the cluster and launch 3 pods running each crypto mining each. Each of these pods took up CPU significantly and impact our service.

3. Summary of what was affected:
   cpu is heavily utilized and cluster under heavy load and slow responsive. This cause valid service requests slow in responding to client requests.
   
4. Summmry of the impact:
   Attacker managed to gain access to the cluster and run the crypto mining software. cluster resources spike and clearly shown in grafana dashboard.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
   1. force delete of miner pods from the cluster 
   kubectl --kubeconfig kube_config_cluster.yml delete pod <pod_name> --grace-period=0 --force

   2. cpu usage back to normal and service back to responsive.
   see the link here, falco_grafana_screenshot.png , check that the graph cpu usage trend going down.
   
   3. review administrative management on cluster API.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
   the cluster should be harden and especially restrict access to the cluster. administrative manager cluster api must be review in order to achieve that.

   Alert need to be setup should cpu usage goes 100% for a period of time in the future. This prevent any other similar incident happening again and response can be put in action faster.
